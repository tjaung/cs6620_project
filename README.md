# CS6620 Cloud Computing - Spring 2026
# Semester Project: Cloud Security Platform

## Project Overview

This semester, you will design and deploy a cloud-based security platform on Amazon Web Services (AWS). You are provided with two foundational security tools:

- **SAST Scanner**: A Static Application Security Testing tool that analyzes source code for vulnerabilities
- **API Penetration Tester**: A dynamic testing tool that probes running APIs for security issues

**Your challenge:** Design a cloud architecture that deploys these tools (one or both) in a way that solves a real problem. You will propose your own architecture, choose appropriate AWS services, and justify your design decisions.

This is not a "follow the recipe" project. You will make architectural decisions, justify your technology choices, and build a system that demonstrates your understanding of cloud computing principles.

## GitHub Actions Security Scan Setup

This project includes a minimal CI/CD integration that lets a GitHub Actions workflow zip a repository, upload it to S3, invoke Lambda, and print the Lambda response in the Actions logs. In the current proof of concept, Lambda reads the uploaded repo zip and prints small file previews. Later, this same Lambda flow can be extended to call the SAST and pentest EC2 services.

### 1. Deploy S3 and Lambda in AWS Learner Lab

Start your AWS Academy Learner Lab and copy the temporary AWS credentials from **AWS Details**. In your terminal, export them using the `*_VALUE` names expected by the deploy script:

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_VALUE="PASTE_LEARNER_LAB_ACCESS_KEY_ID"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_VALUE="PASTE_LEARNER_LAB_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN_VALUE="PASTE_LEARNER_LAB_SESSION_TOKEN"
export AWS_REGION_VALUE="us-east-1"
```

Set the GitHub owner/repo values and a unique project name:

```bash
export GITHUB_OWNER_VALUE="YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME_OR_ORG"
export GITHUB_REPO_VALUE=""
export PROJECT_NAME_VALUE="security-scan-YOUR_NAME"
```

Run the deploy script:

```bash
./scripts/deploy-learner-lab.sh
```

The script deploys the S3 bucket and Lambda, then prints values like:

```text
SECURITY_SCAN_AWS_REGION=us-east-1
SECURITY_SCAN_ARTIFACT_BUCKET=security-scan-YOUR_NAME-artifacts-xxxxxxxx
SECURITY_SCAN_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME=security-scan-YOUR_NAME-repo-reader
```

Save these values. You will add them to the GitHub repo that should run the security test workflow.

### 2. Add GitHub Actions Secrets

In the GitHub repo you want to test, go to:

```text
Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions -> Secrets
```

Add these secrets using your current Learner Lab credentials:

```text
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
AWS_SESSION_TOKEN
```

Learner Lab credentials expire, so update these secrets whenever your lab session refreshes.

### 3. Add GitHub Actions Variables

In the same GitHub repo, go to:

```text
Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions -> Variables
```

Add the values printed by the deploy script:

```text
SECURITY_SCAN_AWS_REGION
SECURITY_SCAN_ARTIFACT_BUCKET
SECURITY_SCAN_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME
```

### 4. Add the Workflow YAML

In the repo you want to test, create:

```text
.github/workflows/securitytests.yaml
```

Use this workflow:

```yaml
name: Security Tests

on:
  push:
  pull_request:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  security-tests:
    uses: YOUR_GITHUB_OWNER/YOUR_SECURITY_PLATFORM_REPO/.github/workflows/securitytests.yaml@main
    permissions:
      id-token: write
      contents: read
    secrets:
      AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
      AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
      AWS_SESSION_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.AWS_SESSION_TOKEN }}
```

Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_OWNER/YOUR_SECURITY_PLATFORM_REPO` with the GitHub repo where this security platform project is pushed. The workflow runs on every branch push, on pull requests, and when manually triggered.

### 5. What Happens When It Runs

The GitHub Action will:

1. Check out the repo being tested.
2. Zip the repo.
3. Upload `repo.zip` to the deployed S3 bucket.
4. Invoke the deployed Lambda.
5. Print the Lambda response in the GitHub Actions logs.

If this succeeds, the CI/CD-to-AWS integration is working. The next step is extending Lambda so it sends source files to the SAST EC2 service and target URLs to the pentest EC2 service.

## Understanding Application Security Testing

### What is SAST (Static Application Security Testing)?

**In simple terms:** SAST tools read source code without running it, looking for patterns that indicate security problems.

**What the provided tool does:**
- Scans JavaScript source code files
- Detects 10 types of vulnerabilities:
  - Hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens)
  - SQL injection risks
  - NoSQL injection risks
  - Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities
  - Path traversal issues
  - Insecure functions (eval, exec)
  - Hardcoded IP addresses
  - Weak randomness (using Math.random() for security)
  - Sensitive data in logs
  - Weak cryptography (MD5, SHA1)
- Returns detailed reports with line numbers, severity levels, and recommendations

**How it works:**
```
Input: JavaScript source code (as text, file, or entire directory)
Process: Pattern matching using regular expressions
Output: JSON report with vulnerabilities found
```

**Real-world use cases:**
- Scan code before committing to Git
- Run automatically in CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions)
- Audit codebases for security issues
- Generate reports for security teams
- Track vulnerability trends over time

**Provided API endpoints:**
- `POST /scan/code` - Scan code snippet
- `POST /scan/file` - Scan a file path
- `POST /scan/directory` - Scan entire directory
- `GET /vulnerabilities` - List detected vulnerability types
- `GET /health` - Health check

**Try it locally:**
```bash
cd sast/backend
npm install
npm start
# Server runs on http://localhost:3000

# Test it
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/scan/code \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"code": "const password = \"admin123\";"}'
```

### What is API Penetration Testing?

**In simple terms:** Pentesting tools interact with running applications to find vulnerabilities by trying to exploit them.

**What the provided tool does:**
- Tests live APIs for security vulnerabilities
- Runs 6 types of security tests:
  - Missing authentication checks
  - SQL injection vulnerabilities
  - NoSQL injection vulnerabilities
  - Rate limiting (brute force protection)
  - Security headers (X-Frame-Options, CSP, etc.)
  - Sensitive data exposure
- Analyzes responses to determine if vulnerabilities exist
- Returns pass/fail/warning status for each test

**How it works:**
```
Input: Target API URL
Process: Send test requests with various payloads, analyze responses
Output: JSON report with test results and findings
```

**Real-world use cases:**
- Regular security scanning of production APIs
- Scheduled monitoring (hourly, daily, weekly)
- Alert teams when new vulnerabilities appear
- Compliance testing (security audits)
- Compare security posture over time

**Provided API endpoints:**
- `POST /scan` - Run all tests against target URL
- `POST /scan/:testId` - Run specific test
- `GET /tests` - List available tests
- `GET /health` - Health check

**Also included:** A deliberately vulnerable test API (`test-target.js`) for testing purposes.

**Try it locally:**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the vulnerable test target
cd pentest/backend
npm install
node test-target.js
# Runs on http://localhost:4000

# Terminal 2: Start the pentest server
npm start
# Runs on http://localhost:3000

# Terminal 3: Run a test
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/scan \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"targetUrl": "http://localhost:4000/api/users"}'
```

## Why These Tools Matter (Static vs Dynamic)

| Aspect | SAST (Static) | Pentesting (Dynamic) |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|
| **When** | During development | On running systems |
| **What it tests** | Source code | Live application |
| **Catches** | Code-level issues | Runtime/config issues |
| **Speed** | Very fast | Slower (makes HTTP requests) |
| **False positives** | Higher | Lower |

**In practice:** Organizations use both together for comprehensive security coverage.

## Your Task: Design a Cloud Architecture

You are NOT implementing a pre-defined solution. Instead, you will:

1. **Understand the tools** - Explore the provided codebases
2. **Identify a use case** - Who would use this? What problem does it solve?
3. **Design a cloud architecture** - Choose AWS services and justify them
4. **Propose your plan** - Meet with instructor to discuss your approach
5. **Implement and deploy** - Build your system on AWS
6. **Demonstrate and defend** - Show it works and explain your decisions

---

## Key Questions to Consider

### Use Case & Requirements
- Are you deploying one tool or both? Why?
- If both, how do they work together?
- Who is your target user? (Developers? Security teams? Both?)
- How will users interact with your system?
- What features beyond the base scanner/tester add value?

### Data Storage Decisions
- What data needs to be stored? (Scan results? User data? Configuration?)
- Which AWS service makes sense?
  - **S3**: Object storage for reports, scan artifacts, logs
  - **RDS**: Relational database for structured queries
  - **DynamoDB**: NoSQL for flexible schemas, fast lookups
  - **MongoDB Atlas**: External managed MongoDB (not AWS, but allowed if justified)
  - **EFS**: Shared file system across multiple instances
- How long is data retained?
- Do you need data backup/versioning?

### Compute Architecture
- **EC2**: Traditional VMs you manage
- **ECS/Fargate**: Container orchestration
- **Lambda**: Serverless functions (for scheduled scans? webhooks?)
- **Elastic Beanstalk**: Platform-as-a-service (less control, easier deployment)
- Do you need auto-scaling? Load balancing?
- How do you handle updates/deployments?

### Networking & Security
- Public vs private subnets?
- Security groups - what ports? What sources?
- Do you need a VPC? NAT Gateway?
- How are secrets managed? (Environment variables? AWS Secrets Manager? Parameter Store?)
- SSL/TLS for HTTPS?

### Integration & Automation
- Is this integrated with GitHub Actions? How?
- Scheduled scanning? (CloudWatch Events + Lambda?)
- Webhooks for alerts? (SNS? API calls to Slack/Discord?)
- API Gateway for managing access?

### Monitoring & Observability
- How do you know if your system is working?
- CloudWatch logs? Metrics? Alarms?
- Dashboard for system health?
- Cost monitoring?

## Example Architectures (For Inspiration)

### Example 1: Simple SAST-as-a-Service

**Use case:** Developers paste code snippets to check for vulnerabilities

```mermaid
graph LR
    User[User Browser] --> CF[CloudFront CDN]
    CF --> S3[S3 Static Website<br/>Frontend]
    User --> APIG[API Gateway]
    APIG --> Lambda[Lambda Function<br/>SAST Scanner]
    Lambda --> DDB[(DynamoDB<br/>Scan Results)]

    style S3 fill:#FF9900
    style Lambda fill:#FF9900
    style DDB fill:#FF9900
    style APIG fill:#FF9900
    style CF fill:#FF9900
```

**Justification:**
- **Serverless** = no server management, auto-scaling
- **DynamoDB** = fast, simple key-value storage for scan results
- **S3 + CloudFront** = cheap, fast frontend hosting
- **API Gateway** = managed API endpoints with built-in throttling
- **Pay only when scans run** - cost effective for low/variable usage

**Cost estimate:** ~$5-10/month for moderate usage

---

### Example 2: Enterprise Pentest Platform

**Use case:** Security team schedules regular scans of company APIs

```mermaid
graph TB
    User[Users] --> ALB[Application Load Balancer]
    ALB --> EC2_1[EC2 Instance<br/>Frontend Dashboard]
    ALB --> ASG[Auto Scaling Group<br/>EC2 Instances<br/>Pentest Workers]
    ASG --> RDS[(RDS PostgreSQL<br/>Results, Schedules, Users)]

    EB[EventBridge<br/>Scheduled Rules] --> Lambda[Lambda Trigger]
    Lambda --> SQS[SQS Queue<br/>Scan Jobs]
    SQS --> ASG
    ASG --> SNS[SNS Topic]
    SNS --> Slack[Slack Webhook]
    SNS --> Email[Email Notifications]

    style ALB fill:#FF9900
    style EC2_1 fill:#FF9900
    style ASG fill:#FF9900
    style RDS fill:#FF9900
    style EB fill:#FF9900
    style Lambda fill:#FF9900
    style SQS fill:#FF9900
    style SNS fill:#FF9900
```

**Justification:**
- **RDS PostgreSQL** = complex queries for historical analysis, user management, relational data
- **Auto Scaling Group** = handle multiple concurrent scans, scale based on queue depth
- **SQS** = decouple job submission from execution, prevent worker overload
- **EventBridge** = reliable scheduled scanning with cron expressions
- **SNS** = flexible alerting to multiple channels (Slack, email, PagerDuty)
- **ALB** = distribute traffic, health checks, SSL termination

**Cost estimate:** ~$50-100/month with reserved instances

---

### Example 3: Combined Security Platform

**Use case:** Complete security platform with both static and dynamic testing

```mermaid
graph TB
    GH[GitHub Actions<br/>Push/PR Events] --> Webhook[Webhook]
    Webhook --> Lambda_GH[Lambda<br/>SAST Trigger]
    Lambda_GH --> S3_Reports[S3 Bucket<br/>Detailed Reports]

    User[Users] --> EC2[EC2 Instance<br/>NGINX + React Dashboard<br/>+ Node.js API]

    EC2 --> DDB[(DynamoDB<br/>Scan Metadata<br/>Quick Queries)]
    EC2 --> S3_Reports

    EC2 --> ECS[ECS Fargate<br/>Pentest Workers<br/>Isolated Containers]

    ECS --> CW[CloudWatch Logs & Metrics]
    CW --> Lambda_Alert[Lambda<br/>Alert Function]
    Lambda_Alert --> SNS[SNS]
    SNS --> Alerts[Slack/Email/PagerDuty]

    DDB --> S3_Archive[S3 Glacier<br/>Long-term Archive]

    style EC2 fill:#FF9900
    style Lambda_GH fill:#FF9900
    style Lambda_Alert fill:#FF9900
    style S3_Reports fill:#FF9900
    style S3_Archive fill:#FF9900
    style DDB fill:#FF9900
    style ECS fill:#FF9900
    style CW fill:#FF9900
    style SNS fill:#FF9900
```

**Justification:**
- **Combines both tools** in one unified platform
- **GitHub webhook integration** for SAST in CI/CD pipeline
- **ECS Fargate** for pentesting = isolated containers, no server management, scales to zero
- **S3 for reports** = cheap storage for large detailed reports (HTML/PDF)
- **DynamoDB for metadata** = fast queries for dashboard (latest scans, summaries, counts)
- **S3 Glacier** = archive old reports cheaply (compliance/auditing)
- **CloudWatch** monitors both services, triggers alerts on failures or critical findings
- **Separation of concerns** = different compute for different workloads

**Cost estimate:** ~$30-60/month depending on scan frequency

---

### Example 4: CI/CD Security Gate

**Use case:** Block pull requests if code has high-severity vulnerabilities

```mermaid
graph LR
    GH[GitHub Pull Request] --> GHA[GitHub Actions Workflow]
    GHA --> EC2[EC2 Instance<br/>SAST Scanner Service<br/>Always Running]
    EC2 --> S3[(S3 Bucket<br/>Scan Reports)]
    EC2 --> GHA_Status[Status Check<br/>Pass/Fail]
    GHA_Status --> GH
    S3 --> GH_Comment[GitHub PR Comment<br/>Link to Report]

    EC2 --> CW[CloudWatch Alarms]
    CW --> SNS[SNS Alert]
    SNS --> DevOps[DevOps Team]

    style EC2 fill:#FF9900
    style S3 fill:#FF9900
    style CW fill:#FF9900
    style SNS fill:#FF9900
```

**Justification:**
- **Simple and focused** on one problem: preventing insecure code from merging
- **EC2 instance always running** = fast response times for developers (no cold start)
- **S3** = cheap storage for detailed reports developers can review
- **GitHub Actions integration** = fits into existing developer workflow
- **Pass/fail status** = blocks merge if high-severity issues found
- **CloudWatch monitoring** = alerts if scanner service goes down (critical for CI/CD gate)

**Cost estimate:** ~$15-20/month (t3.small instance)

## Ideas for Extensions

### SAST Scanner Extensions
- Support additional languages (Python, Java, Go)
- GitHub App that comments on pull requests
- Historical trend analysis and dashboards
- Custom rules configuration
- Report generation (PDF/HTML)
- Integration with Jira/GitHub Issues for tracking
- Severity threshold configuration (block on HIGH, warn on MEDIUM)

### Pentest Extensions
- Additional security tests (CORS, CSRF, XML injection, HTTP method testing)
- Scheduled scanning with configurable intervals
- Comparison between scans (what changed? new vulnerabilities?)
- Multi-target testing (scan multiple APIs)
- Webhook alerts (Slack, Discord, PagerDuty, email)
- Compliance reports and dashboards
- Rate limit configuration per target

### Platform Ideas (Combining Both)
- Single dashboard for both static and dynamic testing
- Correlate findings (code issue → runtime vulnerability)
- Complete CI/CD security pipeline
- Security score/grade calculation
- Multi-tenancy (multiple teams/projects)
- User authentication and team management
- Audit logging of all scans

---
